## why?:
Radiology is a lonely field as many of the decisions about imaging are made by one or maybe two radiologists. That makes it prone to error as well as making radiologists prone to burnout. This has meant that AI has a huge opportunity, especially when looking at possible doctor shortages and already high health care burdens that make imaging hard to access. However, the ways in which AI had been implemented didn't necessarily mean that radiologists would perform better and when their performance is directly linked to lives that performance (particularly in accuracy) is vital.

The article simply reveals that AI has been largely ineffective with those with low baseline accuracy remaining in a similar state, and the same can be said about those at consistently high baselines for accuracy. There are some who perfromed better but also some worse and some unchanged however that range wasn't super significant. It's clear that there's much work to be done in the area which isn't particularly easy, of course this is because it's already hard to idenitfy issues accurately from imaging if the scans aren't done very well (possibly another opportunity for the field.) However, also because diseases are different for everyone meaning there should be issues similar to what AI is facing in facial recognition but much harder due to the private nature of patient information and the everchanging visual of images depending on disease stage. 

## Comments

Lucia Song: I found this article to be very interesting! AI can be both harmful and beneficial to human practices that take years to master. AI is only as good as its sources and training methods. To me, it was not too surprising that porrly performing AIs negatively affected certain professional fields such as radiology.

## Comment by Jun Li:
I think it’s interesting to see that AI’s impact on radiologists isn’t as game-changing as some might have hoped. The results are mixed—AI hasn’t really improved accuracy for those already struggling, and for those doing well, it didn’t make much of a difference either. However, I believe AI still has a long way to go, especially with ongoing technological advancements. In the future, it can play a supportive role for radiologists rather than replacing them entirely.
